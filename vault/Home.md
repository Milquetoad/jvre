# jvre — Learning Vault

Knowledge base for **jvre** (Java Vulkan Rendering Engine): a from-scratch rendering framework built to *learn* graphics, Vulkan, and the Java↔native ecosystem.

> This vault is maintained continuously alongside the code. Every concept we cover gets (or updates) a note here. Newest activity is in [[Progress Log]].

## Map of Content

### Project
- [[Toolchain Setup]] — what's installed and why
- [[Progress Log]] — dated diary of what we've done
- [[API Vision - Layered Altitudes]] — the engine's north star (high-level + shader-art on one stack)
- [[Device Selection and Cross-Platform (planned)]] — flexible GPU choice + OS-agnostic (post-MVP)

### Foundations (Java ↔ native)
- [[Build Tools]]
- [[Gradle]]
- [[Gradle Wrapper]]
- [[LWJGL]]
- [[GLFW]]
- [[JNI]]
- [[Off-Heap Memory]]
- [[MemoryStack]]
- [[Shaders - GLSL and SPIR-V]]
- [[Consuming and Publishing Libraries]]
- [[Creating a Gradle Project from Scratch]]
- [[Testing and CI-CD]]

### Vulkan
- [[Vulkan Overview]]
- [[Roadmap - Clear to Color]]
- [[Vulkan Struct Conventions]] — the `sType`/`pNext` pattern
- [[Windowing - GLFW and the Surface]] — who makes the window (not Vulkan!)
- [[GUI Options]] — ImGui / Nuklear (GLFW has no widgets)
- [[Self-Built GUI (planned)]] — our own immediate-mode GUI (later milestone)
- [[Ray Tracing and Path Tracing (future)]] — yes, reachable (compute + hardware RT on the 4090)
- [[Vulkan Instance]] ✅
- [[Validation Layer and Debug Messenger]] ✅ — the safety net
- [[Physical Device and Queue Families]] ✅ — picking a GPU, queues, present support

## Status
- ✅ Toolchain verified (smoke test passes)
- ✅ Vulkan SDK installed (`glslc` works)
- ✅ [[Vulkan Instance]] created & running
- ✅ [[Validation Layer and Debug Messenger]] (safety net, demonstrated catching a bug)
- ✅ Surface (`VkSurfaceKHR`) created — window connected to Vulkan
- ✅ [[Physical Device and Queue Families]] — picked the RTX 4090 (graphics + present, scored)
- ⏭️ Next: **logical device + queues** — create a `VkDevice` and get our queue handles
